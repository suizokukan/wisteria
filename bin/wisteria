        BEWARE ! This file is only here to easily create an executable script
                 to be used by developpers. But this file isn't the entry
                 point of the program, which is wisteria.main.py::main().
                 Pypi creates an entry point from this last file, not from
                 the current one !

        ________________________________________________________________________

        about exit codes, see documentation : 'exit codes'

          This script stops and raises a -999 exit code if wisteria is already
        installed.
